# Haskell-Models of Computation
 
Models of Computation is more like a theoretical course than practical course. It uses Haskell as support language to help student understand lecture content. As a result, we learn this language by ourselves and have limited training about it. The code I posted there is my answer about our assignment, which solves the question correctly and gets full mark.
